Power Meter Pulse LED
=====================

A simple Arduino sketch to simulate the Pulse-LED, found on some Electricity Power Meters.

It only does fixed wattage, for now. I've thought about doing some kind of simulation of real power consumption patterns, I but don't need or have any use for that. I basically only need a fixed wattage, so I easily can check the accuracy of the device which is tracking usage with a Photodiode.

The default power consumption is set at 1000 Watt, with a pulse rate of 1000 blinks per kWh, but you can change that in the code.

Components
----------

* A White LED (other colours might work).
* A 330Î© resistor (or anything from 220 to 1k).
* An ESP board (I recommend an ESP32, but an ESP8266 might work for you)

Here's a picture of the test-bed I used to test the accuracy of my [ESPHome Power Meter](https://github.com/zenzay/esphome-projects/tree/main/power-meter).
